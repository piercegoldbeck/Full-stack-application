User Stories

The user will be able to go to the Product Gallery page. This is a simplified version of how an instagram post would be made. The user will be able to upload a new product including all elements in the schema that was created. Once the user saves the new product or cancels the option to create a new product, they will be directed back to the page they began at. The user will also be provided with the options to view each product individually, edit each product, and even delete the products that exist on the site itself. Last, there will be a comment section for each user where they will be able to create a comment, edit a comment, and delete the comments that were made.

The project itself was created using a models, views, and controllers concept. The server.js file acts as the middle man between the views in which the user interacts with on the website and the backend which is directly talking to the database.

Major Hurdles

The major difficulty I came across was learning how to properly understand how routes interacted with the requests in which the user requested from the database. Due to the fact that we were not dealing with static files for this project, it was important to understand the use of dynamic ejs files.
